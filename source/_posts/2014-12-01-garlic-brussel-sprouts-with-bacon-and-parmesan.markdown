Here's a recipe I partially adapted from one I found online.

## Ingredients

1. 3 strips of bacon
2. 1 cup of brussel sprouts
3. Powdered parmesan cheese
4. 4 cloves of diced garlic
5. Salt (half to one teaspoon)
6. Black pepper

## Instructions

Start by cooking the three strips of bacon (without using oil). While doing so, remove the outer leaves of the brussel sprouts, then cut each in half and wash. Once bacon is done, leave bacon oil in the pan (if it's too oily, take some out). Start frying the garlic in the pan (use slightly under medium heat) until they turn slightly brown, then throw in the brussel sprouts. Try to keep the flat part down so it absorbs the flavor. Add black pepper and sprinkle salt. While frying, chop the bacon strips into thin slices and throw them in with the brussel sprouts. Continue frying for 3 - 4 minutes. Finally, add parmesan cheese.
