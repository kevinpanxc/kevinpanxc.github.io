Michelle and I decided to bike to Santa Cruz on President's Day Weekend. The distance from San Francisco to Santa Cruz, if you stick to the west coast down Cabrillo Highway, is about 130km, or 80 miles for the imperially inclined. I've biked relatively long distances before in a day but never this long. In my last internship in the Bay Area, I had biked from Palo Alto to San Francisco downtown which is about 60km and there was another bike trip this term up north in Marin County where I biked for a bit more than 60km. Maybe it was 70, I don't remember. In any case, for experienced bikers, this is not too bad but for a fledgling one like myself, this is a significant undertaking.

My bike is a used 2015 Raleigh Revenio 1.0, the most beginner of beginner road bikes. However, compared to the old hybrid bike I was using last work term, a road bike is a tremendous improvement. I really like the colour scheme it has going for it too. White handle bars, white tires, and a silvery-white frame that has drawn praise where praise is not deserved. Yes, to the inexperienced observer, this bike was definitely not crappy (not that I would call my bike crappy, even though it's not something to write home about). Michelle's bike, on the other hand, is a really nice and new Specialized Dolce.

The biggest mistake I made before this trip was ever commiting to the 130km in one day, specifically because I had nowhere near enough sleep for me to push through. I had a bout of insomnia a couple days before the trip for whatever reason. I wasn't nervous, I ate well, I exercised, and yet my mind ran circles around me when it was time to sleep. As such, I slept a grand total of 2 hours the night before the big trip. Yes, 2 hours. Not 4, not 3, but 2. The last time I did this I was mercilessly butchered by a Stats exam (and no, it was not because I wasn't prepared, or so I would like to think). In any case, people that know me know that I need sleep. I can hardly survive on 6 hours or less of sleep and that is without hours on end of rigorous biking. 2 hours of sleep and 130km of biking made for an insurmountable goal.

Hindsight is 20/20 and I mistakenly commit to this goal. Was I worried? Yes. Was I foolish? Doubly so. But where's the fun in life without the risks? So I woke up at 6 in the morning feeling like a zombie fresh out of a coffin, cleaned myself up, picked up my packed gear, and headed out to meet Michelle. Our plan was to stay in Santa Cruz for a couple nights before biking back on Monday.

The first few kilometres as we cut through the city were quite tiring honestly. I've never biked with this much weight on my back. Two full water bottles, a bike lock, a change of clothes, and energy bars made for a sore back. The iota of sleep I had the night before didn't help either. Most bikers distribute this weight on little pouches around the bike which not only keeps the centre of gravity low, but also puts less strain on the body and more so on the legs. Me, being a complete newbie to long distance biking, had a backpack.

It was quite surprising to me, after around 15 km of biking when we reached Skyline Drive, that my mind and body seemingly did a complete 360 and I felt like I had all the energy in the world. Perhaps it's the cardio I've been doing for so long, or perhaps it's the delicious McDonald's™ Sausage McMuffin with Egg sandwich I devoured for breakfast. In any case, the sore back, the all around tiredness from before, it was all gone once we reached this quiet, quaint neighbourhood road that was right by the coast. Unfortunately, most of the ocean view was blocked by the houses lining the west side of the road.

All this changed when we hit a right and turned onto Palmetto Avenue. Right there in front of us was the Pacific coast, blue ocean that stretched across the horizon, the faint smell of salt in the gentle breeze, and the soft rumble of distant waves crashing against the shore. This ride was going to be breathtaking, and this was just a preview for what lay ahead.

The first significant landmark was the Pacifica State Beach of which the following BEAUTIFUL and ARTISTIC photo was taken (Michelle doesn't think so but she's wrong ;)). We continued hugging the coast, riding south for a few kilometres before veering off to the right on Crespi Drive to head for the mountains. Yes. That's right, mountains, because apparently this is much more preferred than biking down the next stretch of highway.

In any case, the mountain road was quite steep, we needed to climb around 300 metres of elevation in 3-4 kilometers. The road was poorly maintained, although we did see quite a few bikers on road bikes climbing with us. And here lies the third mistake. I have never learned the proper form to climbing whilst biking and I think I unnecessarily expanded a large amount of energy going up. I mean, I felt great but we still had around a 100km more to bike for the rest of the day, and definitely many more climbs. It was naïve of me to spend any significant amount of energy here.

The road down the mountain was even worse than the way up. It was basically a glorified stretch of dirt and rocks. Definitely not road bike territory. There were tons of holes and ridges in the path that made for a jarring ride down. At least the view was nice. We could see the ocean again.

It was going down this mountain road that I had the first fall I can ever remember in a long while. And it was terrible. There was this ridge in the dirt path that my front tire slid on and I careened off the bike. My left elbow and knees suffered pretty large scrapes, especially my elbow. It was a mess of torn skin, tissue, blood, and dirt. Man, why didn't I bring any sort of first aid supplies on this trip. THANKFULLY, Michelle, being the ever cautious, ever wise friend, had polysporin. I was quite worried about a terrible infection since the next pharmacy was miles south in Half Moon Bay. This is me here with a poorly washed wound and makeshift gauze that comprised of my spare boxers and a rubber hair band. Marvelous.

This fall hit my drive hard. By the time we reached Half Moon Bay, the 2 hours of sleep really started to get to me. I had a hard time keeping my eyes open in the blazing noon sun. I really just wanted to turn that flaming ball of hydrogen off. Half Moon Bay, despite it's name, was NOT the halfway point to Santa Cruz. There was still a whopping 80km to our destination. 80 KILOMETRES and I'm already in this state. Kevin, why didn't you just stop?

We stopped by a plaza to get some first aid and food. At this point, I was really starting to feel the drowsiness. Could I make it? Could I ride another 80km? Perhaps it was because of this sad state that I couldn't make a rational decision. We were only 50km into the bike ride! How could we stop now? Little did I know the next motel past Half Moon Bay was miles, miles south. Kevin, why didn't you check?

So I paddle and I paddle and the afternoon sun kept beating down on me and I kept fighting off the doubt. At one point in time, I started closing my eyes even as we biked down the relatively busy highway. A little past Half Moon Bay were two pretty massive climbs, 150 metres of elevation each and it was here that I knew I couldn't go any further. Poor climbing form, an intense drowsiness, and a badly injured elbow made for a potent combination. At one point, I remember having to stop at a rather large highway shoulder halfway up a climb to lie down and rest by the grass. The large shoulder was not a coincidence, the view of the Pacific coast here was incredible but all I wanted was a cozy bed and a roof above. At the top of the second climb, we decided to pump my bike tires of my bike since this really helps with the speed of the bike. What a disaster this was! The janky $20 portable bike pump I got online coughed and wheezed air into the tires and it was definitely a workout pumping that thing. At one point we completely deflated the back tire because a little rubbery ring came off the tip of the pump and we had no idea what it was for. So we foolishly attached the nozzle to the tire, the typical loud wheezing sound occurs but never subsides. As the gauge hand of the pump swung left at an ever accelerating rate, panic ensued. Luckily it was just a matter of pushing and proding the ring back into the pump nozzle. Anyways, I drained a large amount of what remained of my energy because of this pumping debacle and I was ready to call it quits.

We had no idea things were going to get much, much worse.

PS: definitely not sorry for the title pun
