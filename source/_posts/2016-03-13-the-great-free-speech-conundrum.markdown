Freedom of speech is generally defined as "the right to communicate one's opinions and ideas without fear of government retaliation or censorship". Sounds perfectly reasonable and perfectly necessary for a modern society. A government that allows it's citizens to voice their opinions is a government that welcomes innovation, improvement, and very importantly, protects itself from corruption.

However, reality is infinitely more complex. The modern information age allows people that are tens of thousands of miles away to communicate as if they were right next to each other. Opinions and ideas can be spread to millions of people halfway across the globe in an instant. This obviously comes with a myriad of advantages for civilization at large. The quick distribution of ideas enables collaboration and innovation at a scale never before seen. BUT, it also allows for malicious entities to manipulate millions of people quickly and efficiently.

Before I continue, I would like to point out how powerful a unified, angry population is. Governments throughout the ages have been created and toppled by the will of the governed. Notable historical Western examples include the French and Russian revolutions where impoverished, passionate peasants tore down monarchies and executed the de facto rulers. More recent examples include the Arab Spring revolutions.

Now let's shift perspectives. Humans are by nature competitive creatures and this trait is, if I dare say, amplified even further at the level of statehood. Most governments want the best for their population. A happy population makes for a successful government and one of the most direct ways to achieve this is through wealth. But wealth is not an infinite resource and when certain countries adopt foreign policies that directly affects another's ability to grow in wealth, or stay wealthy, conflicts occur. In many cases, direct, open warfare follows. Fortunately, wars are risky, time consuming, and expensive.

A much more desirable option is to utilize the will of a government's own people to change said government's policies. The reasoning is crystal clear here. Why would you send your own citizens to fight wars when you could have the citizens of your enemies fight your wars for you?

But how does one government go about turning a significant group of a foreign country's population against their own government? Ever heard of the term propaganda? Now let's look at the internet and how incredibly easy it is to voice opinions and spread a message. Let's be frank here, the internet is truly a perfect medium for propaganda dissemination. Foreign policy makers all over the world are not stupid; they understand the power of the internet and are actively using it to their advantage.

This is where the great free speech conundrum manifests itself. In an ideal world, a government would want its population to exercise free speech. What it does not want is to have foreign entities abuse local free speech policies to foster dissent and general social unrest. But how does one go about filtering out the "evil" speech from the "good" speech. When do you cross the line and start encroaching on the free speech rights of your own citizens? This is an incredibly hard problem that deserves more awareness and discussion than it receives today. I am of the opinion that people are quick to shun certain policies that have potential to violate free speech but is at the same time, necessary to protect the population from foreign, malevolent forces.

In any case, my main goal for this post is to hopefully get the reader thinking about this issue. As I've mentioned before, there is really no easy solution to the free speech conundrum (case in point, the NSA). However, I am hopeful that there is definitely a solution out there that correctly balances free speech and "internet protection" (sorry, I couldn't think of a better term...) and the more dialogue there is on this issue, the faster we can reach a sensible compromise.
