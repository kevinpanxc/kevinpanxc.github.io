Having biked 10 miles down Highway 1 from Half Moon Bay, Google Maps wanted us to veer off the highway onto a small road known as Stage Road. Apparently the next stretch of highway was hazardous enough for biking to warrant going into the mountains again. At the time, I had no idea this was the case since Michelle was the one with the offline map downloaded. In any case, looking at the route now, the detour consisted of several hundred meter climbs, up and down, up and down... Definitely not ideal for biking. Why Google Maps would ever suggest going through this route versus the alternative of heading straight south on Highway 1 is a mystery to me.

We were met with a steep downhill as we entered Stage Road. As fun as downhill cycling is, I was quite worried. Another downhill meant another uphill if we ever decided to head back to Half Moon Bay and that was more than possible given my current state. The downhill ended at an intersection between Stage Road and La Honda Road and here was a quaint and rather large store known as the San Gregario General Store. I had a sinking suspicion that this store was the largest concentration of civilization we would encounter for miles from here on out and told Michelle we should stop here. It was somewhere between turning into Stage Road and stopping here that I decided I couldn't go on any further. I told Michelle so and suggested that we should find a motel nearby and call it a day. Coming off our bikes, the first thing I checked was whether I could hail an Uber. This was a completely futile attempt. First of all, we were basically in the middle of nowhere and no sane Uber driver would ever expect any business here. Second, even if there was an Uber driver out there ready to rescue two stranded cyclists, we had no phone signal so that was the end of that.

The next logical thing to do was to ask for help in the store. At the very least we get to take a break and plan our next moves. Walking into the store, I definitely felt like this was no ordinary roadside shop. The San Gregario General Store has what some Americans would refer to as an "old-country-store atmosphere". What made it "old-country" for me was perhaps the myriad of small paintings, trinkets and ornaments on display combined with a gentle prevalence of wood. The store had an air of antiqueness to it. It exuded a sense of history.  

The San Gregario General Store sold a wide assortment of very general things. You could find all the usual convenience store items like cold pop, energy bars, and candy. You could also find things you would expect in a souvenir store, like t-shirts, lapel pins, calendars, and mugs. The store also sold a large variety of books. There were books from all sorts of genres; paperback novels, history books, books on religion, books on geography, what have you. The store apparently sold "hardware" as well, though probably further back as I didn't see any.  

On a sunny Saturday afternoon, there were very many people here. It was generally a mix of bikers (the leather jacket, combustion engine kind) and weekend road-tripping families. I caught the bartender in one of the brief moments she had between taking orders and pouring drinks and inquired about lodging options nearby. "The nearest ones are 10 miles up north by Half Moon Bay, or you could also go 10 miles south. There's a small hostel by the lighthouse." Both options sounded terrible to me.  

Michelle was keen on the lighthouse hostel since, at the very least, we didn't have to head back and lose progress. She had a weak signal on her phone and we tried to connect to the hostel's website. It took ages. Completely frustrating. When the website finally loaded and we found a number to call, nothing comes up. The connection was so poor we gave up trying to find an address and directions.  

10 minutes later we found ourselves sitting by one of the tables in front of the bar. A few men with guitars and banjos walk up to the corner of the store and started setting up mic stands. Apparently there was going to be live music in the middle of the afternoon. How quaint. Michelle and I were in no mood to appreciate this though. Earlier, she had asked the bartender about getting a cab back to Half Moon Bay and was dismissively told that was not possible. The bartender grumpily mumbled something about "trying our Ubers". Her attempts at asking for WiFi next were also handily denied.  

Our options dwindled down to the most unattractive. Head back to Half Moon Bay or camp out somewhere in the middle of the road for the night? You can imagine how terrible I felt. On the one hand, I was exhausted and drowsy and on the other, I was disappointed at having let Michelle down. The men with the instruments had finished setting up and started their performance. Country music. I'm not surprised.

After what seemed like hours compressed into several minutes, Michelle and I decided we should just keep biking until we find a place by the road to sleep. What terrible circumstances we have found ourselves in... and it was all my fault. Exhaustion and guilt do not make for good companions, especially when you're stranded in rural South Bay.  

Before heading out, I decided to buy more water just in case our current supply doesn't last. Heading back to the store, I spot a middle-aged Asian lady by the counter. She was the only other Asian person we've met in our whole time here and I don't know what came over me but I walked up to her, explained our situation, and asked whether she could give us a ride back to Half Moon Bay. With a look that was a clear mix of bewilderment and compassion, she told me she needed to consult with her husband first. Long story short. He agreed.  

What a godsend. At the very last minute before heading out towards the mountains, we find a couple willing to cut their day trip short to drive us back to Half Moon Bay. I was incredibly relieved.  

George and Thida, as we would later learn of their names, drove a medium-sized BMW sedan and we were doubtful at first whether it would fit both our bikes. With a good deal of shuffling, the bikes eventually settled into the trunk in a rather haphazard fashion as half of the bikes dangled off the end. The bikes were secure, nevertheless, and soon we were well on our way back to town. I tried filling the ride back with small talk that was motivated almost entirely by guilt since I was the sole reason this was all happening in the first place. The side effect from this was that Michelle and I had to hide the fact that we were well off tech interns in the Bay Area. We made up companies, made up salaries, and made up living situations. It was unfortunate that there was even a morsel of a need to fuzzle information, especially for two people that were so gracious to help us. However, given our experience with the staff at the San Gregario General Store, I figured it was better to stay on the safe side.  

We were back in Half Moon Bay in no time and George and Thida dropped us off at a Comfort Inn. They gave us their contact information and bid farewell. I cannot put to words how grateful I am for their generosity. Honestly, there were times back in the store where I did not believe this was possible. Life can be such an emotional rollercoaster some times.  

After hours on end of biking, I have never been happier lying on a bed. For all I care, all my troubles were left behind back by that table in the San Gregario General Store. Tomorrow was going to be a better day!
