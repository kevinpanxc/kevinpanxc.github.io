I'm sitting here in Twitch.tv's video broadcast lab at 11:26pm on a Thursday night because Intel's Quick Sync encoder quietly inserts one extra frame to a 500 frame video if you specify the input video's framerate at 50. This messes up all the objective video metrics leaving me completely perplexed for the majority of the evening.

The lab's empty, most of the office is probably empty, and here I am, one solitary intern who should reallly reallly reallllyy go home soon. It's times like these when you become a philosopher. This phenomenon is akin to that which occurs often in long showers and evening bus rides. The mind wanders and simultaneously ponders the world.

The topic of reflection for tonight was social structures, in particular, systems of government. Democracy vs autocracy. What a classic. I spent most of my life in "Western" societies and I am no stranger to the benevolence of democracy and the dangers of autocracy. It is an undeniable fact that a democractic government is one that poses the least risks for the governed. We cherish our democratic values here and we wear them proudly.

It was then that I realized how contradictory our everyday lives were to democracy. I've never considered this but one of the largest institutions in our lives, at least for the majority of us, is almost entirely nondemocratic. The institution I'm referring to, of course, is the company. 5 days a week we go to work, listen to what our managers want us to do, and do it. By design, the majority of employees often have very little say in the overall direction of the company.

So in short, democracy is put on a pedestal but yet we spend most of our adult lives being part of autocratic machines. Every few years we get to write a name on a piece of paper and put it in a box. Such is life.

Why am I still in the office?
