      <blockquote>
  <p>This post was inspired by Monica Dinculescu’s <a href="http://meowni.ca/posts/cat-dns-cascadia/">speech</a> at CUSEC 2015, “The Internet Needs More Cats”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Internet is so prevalent in our everyday lives but the majority of its users have a very limited understanding of how it works. Admittedly, I am one of them. Recently, I’ve decided to tackle a very small fragment of my Internet ignorance; I wanted to understand how DNS or the Domain Name System works.</p>

<p>DNS is basically the system responsible for translating web addresses such as <code>google.com</code> to IP addresses. These addresses are what’s used internally to identify specific computers among the billions connected over the web. We use domain names instead of IP addresses since the former has a lot more meaning to us as humans and thus are a lot easier to memorize (<code>www.google.com</code> vs <code>http://74.125.224.72/</code>). It’s important to note that DNS, as a service, is not run by any one computer. Instead, the service is offered through an entire network of interconnected computers.</p>

<h2 id="domain-name-syntax">Domain name syntax</h2>

<p>A domain name essentially consists of labels concatenated and delimited by dots. This is just a fancy way to describe the general structure of all the URLs we know and love, like <code>www.facebook.com</code> and <code>www.reddit.com</code>. Each label of a domain name, from right to left, corresponds to a particular level in DNS. For example, the label <code>com</code> is what is generally known as a top level domain or TLD. Other top level domains include <code>ca</code> and <code>cn</code>. Then, the labels <code>facebook</code> or <code>reddit</code> correspond to a lower level in the DNS.</p>

<p>As a side note, there is actually one level above TLDs. This is called the root domain and is represented as a <code>.</code> at the end of all URLs. However, this <code>.</code> is implicit so we usually don’t include it when displaying URLs.</p>

<h2 id="domain-name-space-what-does-all-these-level-stuff-mean">Domain name space (what does all these level stuff mean?)</h2>

<p><img align="right" style="width: 50%" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Domain_name_space.svg" /></p>

<p>The domain name space can be represented as a tree-like structure. Each node represents one particular label in a domain name. The root node would thus correspond to the aforementioned <code>.</code> that is implicitly tagged on to all URLs. TLDs correspond to child nodes of the root node as expected.</p>

<div style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 20px"></div>

<h2 id="practically">Practically…</h2>

<p>A domain name space tree is represented as a distributed database system. DNS name servers, specifically authoritative name servers, assume responsibility over a particular zone in the name space. A zone consists of one or more connected nodes. Each node contains a resource record holding information associated with the current domain name as well as all its child nodes.</p>

<p>As such, to determine an IP address from a domain name, one needs to parse the domain name into the respective labels and traverse the domain name space tree to reach the particular node with the correct IP address.</p>

<h2 id="where-are-all-these-name-servers">Where are all these name servers?</h2>

<p>There are currently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_name_server#Root_server_addresses">13 root name servers</a> located around the world with the majority in the United States. Responsibility of TLD domains is delegated to specific organizations by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). For example, the <code>com</code> TLD was originally administered by the United States Department of Defense but is now administered by Verisign. Lower level domains are managed by various other organizations and private entities.</p>

<h2 id="speeding-things-up">Speeding things up</h2>

<p>Having to traverse through the entire domain name space tree everytime you type <code>www.google.com</code> into your browser address bar is super slow. Again, an age old technique called caching is used to speed things up. Typically, alongside the authoritative name servers making up the domain name space tree are recursive name servers. These servers are often provided by Internet Service Providers (ISP) or other organizations such as Google. These servers are the ones your browser will most likely talk to first when it needs to resolve a domain name.</p>

<p>Recursive name servers provide two essential services. First, they are able to perform a DNS recursion over the domain name space tree to resolve a domain name to an IP address. A DNS recursion is basically a recursive traversal over the domain name space tree using information from the domain name to reach the right authoritative name server and obtain the right IP address. A recursive name server only performs a DNS recursion if its local cache does not contain the IP address mapped to a requested domain name. The second service provided by recursive name servers is caching of successful DNS recursion results so that future queries will not require another expensive DNS recursion. Finally, it is also important to note that IP address caching can also happen at the client level AKA on your computer.</p>

      <p>A couple months ago, a friend of mine wrote a blog <a href="http://luckytoilet.wordpress.com/2014/11/24/visualizing-quaternions-with-unity/">post</a> about how quarternions solve the problem of gimbal lock in 3D animations (which happens when you use Euler angles). This got me interested in learning more about Euler angles and exactly how gimbal lock works.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, Euler angles are three angles that are used to describe the orientation of a rigid body in 3D space. The rigid body itself has a local coordinate system that is initially aligned with a fixed global coordinate system. Each Euler angle then represents an elemental rotation of that local coordinate system about one of its three axes. From this, it should be understood that any specific elemental rotation will depend on all prior elemental rotations.</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
    <iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Quvb54gttUg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> 
</div>

<p>There are 12 possible sequences of rotation axes for any set of Euler angles; the most popular of which is what’s commonly referred to as the 3-2-1 set of Euler angles. In aeronautical terms, this set of Euler angles describes, in order, the yaw, pitch, and roll of an aircraft.</p>

<div style="text-align: center">

<h2 id="gimbal-lock">Gimbal lock</h2>

<p><img align="right" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Gyroscope_operation.gif" /></p>

<p>A gimbal is, according to Wikipedia, a “ring that is suspended so [that] it can rotate about an axis” and gimbals are “typically nested one within another to accomodate rotation about multiple axes”. As such, a nested three-gimbal system can be used to physically model any 3D rotation based on Euler angles.</p>

<p>Gimbal lock occurs when the middle gimbal rotates in such a way that causes the outer and inner gimbals to align in a plane. In this case, rotating both these gimbals in effect only rotates the rigid body on one axis. The resulting system can only rotate on two axes and it has lost one degree of freedom.</p>

<h2 id="gimbal-lock-and-matrices">Gimbal lock and matrices</h2>

<p>Any 2D rotation in 3D space can be described using a matrix. For example, the matrix below represents a rotation about the $z$-axis with a counter-clockwise angle of $\theta$ (a positive angle if you use the right-hand rule).</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta & 0\\
\sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>The gimbal lock problem can be shown mathematically by representing a 3D rotation based on Euler angles with matrices. For a 3-2-1 rotation, the corresponding mathematical expression would be:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[

R = 
\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos\alpha & -\sin\alpha\\ 0 & \sin\alpha & \cos\alpha\\\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}\cos\beta & 0 & \sin\beta\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\ -\sin\beta & 0 & \cos\beta\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}\cos\gamma & -\sin\gamma & 0\\\sin\gamma & \cos\gamma & 0\\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}
 %]]></script>

<p>The rightmost matrix represents a rotation about the $z$-axis (yaw), the middle matrix represents a rotation about the $y$-axis (pitch), and the leftmost matrix represents a rotation about the $x$-axis (roll). If the pitch angle, $\beta$, was set to $\frac{\pi}{2}$, which basically means the aircraft is pointing straight up, we get:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
R & = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos\alpha & -\sin\alpha\\ 0 & \sin\alpha & \cos\alpha\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1\\0 & 1 & 0\\-1 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\gamma & -\sin\gamma & 0\\\sin\gamma & \cos\gamma & 0\\0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \\

& =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 \\ \sin\alpha\cos\gamma + \cos\alpha\sin\gamma & -\sin\alpha\cos\gamma + \cos\alpha\sin\gamma & 0\\ -\cos\alpha\cos\gamma + \sin\alpha\sin\gamma & \cos\alpha\cos\gamma + \sin\alpha\sin\gamma & 0\\
\end{bmatrix} \\

& = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 \\ \sin(\alpha + \gamma) & \cos(\alpha + \gamma) & 0\\ -\cos(\alpha + \gamma) & \sin(\alpha + \gamma) & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned} %]]></script>

<p>From the above matrix, you can tell that in this state, there is no distinction between yaw and pitch. Applying one change to the yaw angle has the exact effect on the orientation of the aircraft as applying the same change to the roll angle. The system has lost one degree of freedom.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Although I’ve only mathematically shown how gimbal lock occurs in a 3-2-1 system, it is important to note that there is always the possibility of gimbal lock in any other rotation axes sequence. This is a fundamental problem for Euler angles as the map from Euler angles to rotations is not a covering map. In layman’s terms, this means that it is not possible to use Euler angles to represent every 3D rotation. Specifically, for certain values of the second angle, gimbal lock will occur.</p>

<p>Gimbal lock in Euler angles is of practical concern today particularly in the fields of 3D animations and robotics. When it does occur, it leads to weird and undesirable rotation artifacts. Fortunately, there are multiple solutions to this problem. Mechanically, gimbal lock can be solved by adding a fourth gimbal. For 3D animations, a popular solution is to use quarternions instead of Euler angles in calculating rotations.</p>

<p>If, for any reason, you are still confused about what gimbal lock is or how it works, I definitely recommend watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc8b2Jo7mno">video</a>.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2014/12/31/bijective-numeration-and-length-restricted-character-permuations/">Bijective numeration and length-restricted character permutations</a></h1>
      <p>Based on this awesome StackOverflow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/15625853">answer</a>…</p>

<p>Consider the problem where you have a size $N$ set of characters and you need to the generate all possible strings from this set that have length less than or equal to $M$.</p>

<p>Let’s represent the set of characters programmatically as a character array. In this array, each character is mapped to an integer index starting from 0 all the way to $N - 1$. Now consider a base-$N$ numeral system. In this system, there are $N$ symbols to represent the $N$ numbers below 10. We also know that in this system, $N^M - 1$ will evaluate to the largest number that has a string representation of length $M$. So to generate all strings with length less than or equal to $M$, we could just enumerate from 0 to $N^M - 1$ in base $N$ and for each base-$N$ integer, we can create a valid string by replacing each digit of the integer with the character that has the same array index.</p>

<p>For example, if the character array was <code>{'a', 'b', 'c', '3'}</code> and a base-4 number was 312, the equivalent string is <code>3bc</code>.</p>

<p>However, there is a slight problem with this. The strings generated are missing strings with multiple leading characters that is the first character in the array (AKA the character mapped to the 0 index). This is because when you’re iterating from 0 to $N^M - 1$, you would never reach $0000$, for example, since this is just 0. From the above example, that means that you’re missing the string <code>aaaa</code>, even though it is a perfectly valid string if 4 is less than or equal to $M$.</p>

<p>This is where a bijective numeration becomes helpful. A bijective numeration, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective_numeration">Wikipedia</a> is: “any numeral system in which every non-negative integer can be represented in exactly one way using a finite string of digits”.</p>

<p>Conventional numeral systems often have multiple ways to represent the same integer and thus are not bijective. For example, in the numeral system that we’re all familiar with, the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, you can represent the integer 1 an infinite number of ways just by tacking any number of 0’s in front of it. A bijective base-k numeration system ($k$-adic notation) circumvents this by getting rid of the symbol 0 altogether. The value 0 is represented with the empty string, $\varepsilon$. A digit-set of {1, 2, …, k} is used to represent the rest of the positive integers. So, for example, 11110 in base-8 would be represented as 8888 in $k$-adic notation.</p>

<h2 id="from-base-10-to-k-adic-notation">From base-10 to $k$-adic notation</h2>

<p>So, given the understanding of $k$-adic notation, the problem can be solved with a character array where index 0 is mapped to nothing and indices start at 1. We then iterate from 1 to $N^M + N^{M - 1} + \ldots + N$ and convert each integer from base-10 to the $k$-adic notation equivalent before generating the particular string ($N^M + N^{M - 1} + \ldots + N$ is the largest number that has a string representation of length $M$ in $N$-adic). The only question left is how do we convert from base-10 to $k$-adic.</p>

<p>The algorithm is as complex as the algorithm that converts base-10 to base-$N$. Suppose $x$ is the base-10 number we need to convert from and the $k$-adic equivalent is represented by the digit-string $a_n a_{n_1} \ldots a_1 a_0$, then:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
a_0 & = x - q_0 k, q_0 = \lceil \frac{x}{k} \rceil - 1 \\
a_1 & = q_0 - q_1 k, q_1 = \lceil \frac{q_0}{k} \rceil - 1 \\
& \ldots \\
a_n & = q_{n-1} - 0k, q_n = \lceil \frac{q_{n-1}}{k} \rceil - 1 = 0
\end{align} %]]></script>
