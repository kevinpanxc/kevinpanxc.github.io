      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2016/03/13/the-great-free-speech-conundrum/">The Great Free Speech Conundrum</a></h1>
      <p>Freedom of speech is generally defined as “the right to communicate one’s opinions and ideas without fear of government retaliation or censorship”. Sounds perfectly reasonable and perfectly necessary for a modern society. A government that allows it’s citizens to voice their opinions is a government that welcomes innovation, improvement, and very importantly, protects itself from corruption.</p>

<p>However, reality is infinitely more complex. The modern information age allows people that are tens of thousands of miles away to communicate as if they were right next to each other. Opinions and ideas can be spread to millions of people halfway across the globe in an instant. This obviously comes with a myriad of advantages for civilization at large. The quick distribution of ideas enables collaboration and innovation at a scale never before seen. BUT, it also allows for malicious entities to manipulate millions of people quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>Before I continue, I would like to point out how powerful a unified, angry population is. Governments throughout the ages have been created and toppled by the will of the governed. Notable historical Western examples include the French and Russian revolutions where impoverished, passionate peasants tore down monarchies and executed the de facto rulers. More recent examples include the Arab Spring revolutions.</p>

<p>Now let’s shift perspectives. Humans are by nature competitive creatures and this trait is, if I dare say, amplified even further at the level of statehood. Most governments want the best for their population. A happy population makes for a successful government and one of the most direct ways to achieve this is through wealth. But wealth is not an infinite resource and when certain countries adopt foreign policies that directly affects another’s ability to grow in wealth, or stay wealthy, conflicts occur. In many cases, direct, open warfare follows. Fortunately, wars are risky, time consuming, and expensive.</p>

<p>A much more desirable option is to utilize the will of a government’s own people to change said government’s policies. The reasoning is crystal clear here. Why would you send your own citizens to fight wars when you could have the citizens of your enemies fight your wars for you?</p>

<p>But how does one government go about turning a significant group of a foreign country’s population against their own government? Ever heard of the term propaganda? Now let’s look at the internet and how incredibly easy it is to voice opinions and spread a message. Let’s be frank here, the internet is truly a perfect medium for propaganda dissemination. Foreign policy makers all over the world are not stupid; they understand the power of the internet and are actively using it to their advantage.</p>

<p>This is where the great free speech conundrum manifests itself. In an ideal world, a government would want its population to exercise free speech. What it does not want is to have foreign entities abuse local free speech policies to foster dissent and general social unrest. But how does one go about filtering out the “evil” speech from the “good” speech. When do you cross the line and start encroaching on the free speech rights of your own citizens? This is an incredibly hard problem that deserves more awareness and discussion than it receives today. I am of the opinion that people are quick to shun certain policies that have potential to violate free speech but is at the same time, necessary to protect the population from foreign, malevolent forces.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In any case, my main goal for this post is to hopefully get the reader thinking about this issue. As I’ve mentioned before, there is really no easy solution to the free speech conundrum (case in point, the NSA). However, I am hopeful that there is definitely a solution out there that correctly balances free speech and “internet protection” (sorry, I couldn’t think of a better term…) and the more dialogue there is on this issue, the faster we can reach a sensible compromise.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2016/03/12/on-growing-up-with-anxiety/">On growing up with anxiety&#8230;</a></h1>
      <p>To be honest I’m not completely comfortable with writing this post. I guess it’s probably because I’m sharing something about myself that I’m not entirely proud of… sort of like a secret, personal weakness that I’m exposing to the reader. I’ve long been able to cope and even overcome, if I daresay, most of these issues but there is this mysterious mental health stigma that pervades society and is definitely affecting me as I write this. However, I’m quite sure that many people can relate to at least some of my experiences and I hope that by sharing my anxiety story, I can somehow, in some way, help those that are still silently struggling against their inner beast.</p>

<p>My story begins in my adolescent years… sometime during middle school when I had a terrible bout of OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). Like most cases of OCD, it starts out with really minor things like having a tendency to set the audio volume to certain numbers and [ …some other trivial example. I added the “and” for sentence flow and I can’t think of any examples right now]. Most people are like this right? Perfectly normal unless you have a particular sensitivity towards OCD. Unfortunately I did and the symptoms became more and more severe. At the worst stages, I exhibited most of the textbook symptoms of OCD like having elaborate, stressful, and terribly time consuming rituals that involved things like obsessive handwashing and ordering objects in my room (ordering as in making sure everything is in the perfect place, any object that’s even a tad bit off angle MUST be corrected at all costs).</p>

<p>So why did I act out all these “rituals”? At the core of the problem was anxiety. Most of the time I acted because I was scared that if I didn’t, something bad would happen. Maybe this is why there’s this stigma around mental health. It’s just weird, silly, hard to explain, and incredibly embarrassing. In any case, it’s embarrassing at my expense so please keep reading ;)</p>

<p>Also, as a side note, this is why these OCD rituals are so time consuming. If I didn’t do one correctly, I had a primal desire to restart. And restart I did. Many, many times.</p>

<p>One of the ABSOLUTE WORST things about having OCD as a child, at least for me, was that I didn’t understand this and I was scared and embarrassed to talk about it to anyone around me. It wasn’t my OCD symptoms that made it hard for me to share though, it was all the fears, the worrying thoughts that were driving me to act out on them. These thoughts were horrible and often times weird and irrational. So irrational that I don’t even want to talk about them now. Fortunately, I was able to grow out of OCD but I couldn’t free myself of these thoughts.</p>

<p>It is my understanding today that all these negative thoughts were the manifestation of my anxiety. This struggle with OCD was just a small battle in my overarching war against it.</p>

<p>Come high school, I was rid of OCD but anxiety was a monster that clung to me and struck time and time again. I’ve always thought of myself as a little slower to mature emotionally compared to my peers and this, combined with all the negative emotions from anxiety, made a potent combination that, at times, overwhelmed me. Needless to say, high school wasn’t easy.</p>

<p>Again, I kept everything to myself. It was the same story, anxiety created worries and fears that were too weird and embarrassing to share. If I couldn’t share the root cause of my frustration and depression, how could anyone else help?</p>

<p>So I soldiered on and come university, things turned for the better as I became more emotionally mature and as they say, “grew into myself”. But I still had anxiety and I still had these thoughts. They were not necessarily the same as the thoughts a year ago or even a couple months ago but they were just as embarrasing, just as irrational. Anxiety “attacks” were less frequent but not any bit less potent. At the height of any one attack, rational thought is completely and utterly overwhelmed by negative emotions. It sucks.</p>

<p>In any case, this is a HAPPY story and I did eventually overcome anxiety in a spectacular fashion. Word choice is important here, because I never really got rid of anxiety. It’s still a beast that continues today to affect me, albeit in a much more limited and tolerable fashion. I realised sometime around the start of my last school term that I’ve always tackled anxiety the wrong way. I alienated it, fought it, rejected it as a part of who I am. In other words, I couldn’t accept anxiety as being a part of me. But anxiety really is a part of me, and it is one of the many things that define who I am. This one thought, this one realization that I will never get rid of anxiety because it is a part of me made a profound change. Whenever I started obsessing over some stupid anxiety-driven thought, instead of fighting it, I accepted it. I embraced anxiety and stopped trying to control it. In return, my anxiety stopped controlling me. Magically, through acceptance, I stopped worrying.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="a-final-note">A final note…</h2>

<p>I didn’t mention this before but a lot of my anxiety-driven fears have another common theme besides being weird and embarrassing, they were always about LOSS. Somehow, deep within me, there is a strong, primal fear for loss. And this is how acceptance really helped. Instead of fearing loss, I mentally accepted loss. This is really hard to put into words but basically, if I was going to lose something and was powerless to stop it, I will lose it and then this loss becomes a part of who I am. This whole time the one thing that is constant, the one solid thing that I can rely on, is that I am me and that will never change :)</p>

      <p>I’m going to preface this post by saying that I even though I write as if I’m an authoritative figure on leading healthy lifestyles, I’m not. The things I mention here worked and is still working for me. At least that’s what I’m inclined to believe :p</p>

<hr />

<p>For many of us, going to college means living away from home for the first time. There are many other firsts that come with moving out… you might have to start doing your own laundry for the first time, or start cooking your own dinners. As a third year university student, I’ve been through all these firsts and learned quite a few things along the way.</p>

<p>One of the best things about living away from home is the freedom. You get to do whatever you want now without having parents nosing around. But that also means the possibility of developing unhealthy lifestyle habits, especially dietary habits, that you might regret later on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What people are not good at, though, is identifying what’s missing in their diet, mainly because people don’t typically think of these things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me first focus on dietary habits. When it comes to your diet, it’s important to realize that it doesn’t necessarily have to be what you’re eating that makes it unhealthy, it could also be from what you’re NOT eating. I think everyone’s pretty good at identifying generally unhealthy foods (e.g. greasy, sugary, starchy, …) so I won’t elaborate on this. What people are not good at, though, is identifying what’s missing in their diet, mainly because people don’t typically think of these things. Back home, your parents made your food and you ate it. So my best diet advice for you is to keep in mind what nutrients you might have missed out on in your current diet. When I say nutrients I mean things like calcium, iron, vitamin B, and vitamin D.</p>

<p>An extra comment on diet. It’s always good to keep in mind there are some foods that are just so much more efficient than others at giving you the nutrients you need. For example, nuts and seeds are packed with protein, vitamins, and minerals. Find these foods, eat them regularly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And you can’t fault people for this; exercise is painful. Cardio is hard on both the mind and the body, weight lifting is strenuous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Besides a healthy diet, a healthy lifestyle also warrants that you stay physically active (I know, how generic, who doesn’t know this?). Truth is, people do know this but many people don’t act on it. And you can’t fault people for this; exercise is painful. Cardio is hard on both the mind and the body, weight lifting is strenuous. Okay, maybe weight lifting is an exception, since having bulging muscles is strong enough motivation to keep many guys going back to the gym. But cardio, in my experience, is something many people shy away from. Like I mentioned, it’s not easy. You’re often uncomfortable physically and bored out of your mind on that treadmill or elliptical. For me personally, I’ve made cardio, specifically running, a key part of my lifestyle. I’ve run enough times to not have to deal with the physical discomfort part but it’s still often quite boring.</p>

<p>But no worries, it doesn’t have to be this way. There’s another form of exercise I learned recently that, apparently, is significantly better than steady-state cardio. It’s called High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT). Most often applied to running, what it means is to break your running sessions into multiple sprinting and resting periods. For example, you would sprint 1 minute, rest 1 minute, and so forth. This type of exercise burns calories at a much faster rate than steady-state cardio and, as claimed by countless resources online, is just plain better. No matter the calorie burning rate, one thing that’s for sure is that HIIT is not boring. You’re constantly changing your pace so it’s not monotonous and segmenting your workout session into 1 or 2 minute increments make it go by a lot faster. This, to me, is one of the best things about HIIT.</p>

<p>Now that you have a wholesome diet and you’re in love with HIIT and exercising frequently, you must think that you’re all set for a healthy lifestyle right? Yes you are. Why are you still reading?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…a healthy lifestyle isn’t all about being physically healthy. You have to be mentally healthy too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No I’m kidding, a healthy lifestyle isn’t all about being physically healthy. You have to be mentally healthy too. What do I mean by this? Well, sometimes, instead of bingeing on TV shows like Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad or Suits, you might choose to read something that holds more weight… something where you will learn and not just learn for the sake of learning, but learn towards whatever goal you have. I guess the best advice I can give is to make sure you’re PASSIONATE about at least something in life and you’re actively working on improving that thing you’re passionate about. If you aren’t and you find yourself watching too many TV shows or movies or playing too many videos games or partying, maybe you should find that passion.</p>

<p>One of the most common advice I’ve heard from people much older, much wiser than I is to NOT WASTE TIME when you’re young. Time is precious and it might feel like you have a lot now, but it goes by exponentially as you age. And yes, you’ve heard this before, excuse me for being so cliché, but many people simply don’t do anything about it. Don’t be like “many people”, lead a purposeful life.</p>

<p>A middle-aged Vietnamese Uber driver once said to me, <strong>“don’t waste time when you’re young. When you’re young, you have the most energy. Make the most out of it.”</strong></p>
