      <p>Michelle and I decided to bike to Santa Cruz on President’s Day Weekend. The distance from San Francisco to Santa Cruz, if you stick to the west coast down Cabrillo Highway, is about 130km, or 80 miles for the imperially inclined. I’ve biked relatively long distances before in a day but never this long. In my last internship in the Bay Area, I had biked from Palo Alto to San Francisco downtown which is about 60km and there was another bike trip this term up north in Marin County where I biked for a bit more than 60km. Maybe it was 70, I don’t remember. In any case, for experienced bikers, this is not too bad but for a fledgling one like myself, this is a significant undertaking.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img style="width: 60%;" src="http://imgur.com/RQd0aYO.jpg" /></div>

<p>My bike is a used 2015 Raleigh Revenio 1.0, the most beginner of beginner road bikes. However, compared to the old hybrid bike I was using last work term, a road bike is a tremendous improvement. I really like the colour scheme it has going for it too. White handle bars, white tires, and a silvery-white frame that has drawn praise where praise is not deserved. Yes, to the inexperienced observer, this bike was definitely not crappy (not that I would call my bike crappy, even though it’s not something to write home about). Michelle’s bike, on the other hand, is a really nice and new Specialized Dolce.</p>

<p>The biggest mistake I made before this trip was ever commiting to the 130km in one day, specifically because I had nowhere near enough sleep for me to push through. I had a bout of insomnia a couple days before the trip for whatever reason. I wasn’t nervous, I ate well, I exercised, and yet my mind ran circles around me when it was time to sleep. As such, I slept a grand total of 2 hours the night before the big trip. Yes, 2 hours. Not 4, not 3, but 2. The last time I did this I was mercilessly butchered by a Stats exam (and no, it was not because I wasn’t prepared, or so I would like to think). In any case, people that know me know that I need sleep. I can hardly survive on 6 hours or less of sleep and that is without hours on end of rigorous biking. 2 hours of sleep and 130km of biking made for an insurmountable goal.</p>

<p>Hindsight is 20/20 and I mistakenly commit to this goal. Was I worried? Yes. Was I foolish? Doubly so. But where’s the fun in life without the risks? So I woke up at 6 in the morning feeling like a zombie fresh out of a coffin, cleaned myself up, picked up my packed gear, and headed out to meet Michelle. Our plan was to stay in Santa Cruz for a couple nights before biking back on Monday.</p>

<p>The first few kilometres as we cut through the city were quite tiring honestly. I’ve never biked with this much weight on my back. Two full water bottles, a bike lock, a change of clothes, and energy bars made for a soar back. The iota of sleep I had the night before didn’t help either. Most bikers distribute this weight on little poaches around the bike which not only keeps the centre of gravity low, but also puts less strain on the body and more so on the legs. Me, being a complete newbie to long distance biking, had a backpack.</p>

<p>It was quite surprising to me after around 15 kilometres biking when we reached Skyline Drive that my mind and body seemingly did a complete 360 and I felt like I had all the energy in the world. Perhaps it’s the cardio I’ve been doing for so long, or perhaps it’s the McDonald’s™ Sausage McMuffin with Egg sandwich I chomped down for breakfast. In any case, the sore back, the all around tiredness from before, it was all gone once we reach this quiet, neighbourhood road that was right by the coast. Unfortunately, most of the ocean was blocked from view by the houses lining the west side of the road.</p>

<p><img align="left" style="width: 50%; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://imgur.com/1xzayV6.jpg" /></p>

<p>All this changed when we hit a right and turned onto Palmetto Avenue. Right there in front of us was the Pacific coast, blue ocean that stretched across the horizon, the faint smell of salt in the gentle breeze, and the soft rumble of distant waves crashing against the shore. This ride was going to be breathtaking, and this was just a preview to what lay ahead.</p>

<div style="clear: both"></div>

<hr />

<p>The first significant landmark was the Pacifica State Beach of which the following BEAUTIFUL and ARTISTIC photo was taken (Michelle doesn’t think so but she’s wrong ;)). We continued hugging the coast, riding south for a few kilometres before veering off to the right on Crespi Drive to head for the mountains. Yes. That’s right, mountains, because apparently this is much more preferred than biking down the next stretch of highway.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img style="width: 80%;" src="http://imgur.com/wPGO3qd.jpg" /></div>

<p>In any case, the mountain road was quite steep, we needed to climb around 300 metres of elevation in 3-4 kilometers. The road was poorly maintained, although we did see quite a few bikers on road bikes climbing with us. And here lies the third mistake. I have never learned the proper form to climbing whilst biking and I think I unnecessarily expanded a large amount of energy going up. I mean, I felt great but we still had around a 100km more to bike for the rest of the day, and definitely many more climbs. It was naïve of me to spend any significant amount of energy here.</p>

<p>The road down the mountain was even worse than the way up. It was basically a glorified stretch of dirt and rocks. Definitely not road bike territory. There were tons of holes and ridges in the path that made for a jarring ride down. At least the view was nice. We could see the ocean again.</p>

<p><img align="right" style="width: 50%" src="http://imgur.com/Djpbh3A.jpg" /></p>

<p>It was going down this mountain road that I had the first fall I can ever remember in a long while. And it was terrible. There was this ridge in the dirt path that my front tire slid on and I careened off the bike. My left elbow and knees suffered pretty large scrapes, especially my elbow. It was a mess of torn skin, tissue, blood, and dirt. Man, why didn’t I bring any sort of first aid supplies on this trip. THANKFULLY, Michelle, being the ever cautious, ever wise friend, had polysporin. I was quite worried about a terrible infection since the next pharmacy was miles south in Half Moon Bay. This is me here with a poorly washed wound and makeshift gauze that comprised of my spare boxers and a rubber hair band. Marvelous.</p>

<p>This fall hit my drive hard. By the time we reached Half Moon Bay, the 2 hours of sleep really started to get to me. I had a hard time keeping my eyes open in the blazing noon sun. I really just wanted to turn that flaming ball of hydrogen off. Half Moon Bay, despite it’s name, was NOT the halfway point to Santa Cruz. There was still a whopping 80km to our destination. 80 KILOMETRES and I’m already in this state. Kevin, why didn’t you just stop?</p>

</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: center"><img style="width: 80%;" src="http://imgur.com/2dLCHBR.jpg" /></div>

<p>We stopped by a plaza to get some first aid and food. At this point, I started to feel the creeping tendrils of drowsiness envelope my body. Could I make it? Could I ride another 80km? Perhaps it was because of this sad state that I couldn’t make a rational decision. We were only 50km into the bike ride! How could we stop now? Little did I know the next motel past Half Moon Bay was miles, miles south. Kevin, why didn’t you check?</p>

<p>So I paddle and I paddle and the afternoon sun kept beating down on me and I kept fighting off the doubt. At one point in time, I started closing my eyes even as we biked down the relatively busy highway. A little past Half Moon Bay were two pretty massive climbs, 150 metres of elevation each and it was here that I knew I couldn’t go any further. Poor climbing form, an intense drowsiness, and a badly injured elbow made for a potent combination. At one point, I remember having to stop at a rather large highway shoulder halfway up a climb to lie down and rest by the grass. The large shoulder was not a coincidence, the view of the Pacific coast here was incredible but all I wanted was a cozy bed and a roof above. At the top of the second climb, we decided to pump my bike tires of my bike since this really helps with the speed of the bike. What a disaster this was! The janky $20 portable bike pump I got online coughed and wheezed air into the tires and it was definitely a workout pumping that thing. At one point we completely deflated the back tire because a little rubbery ring came off the tip of the pump and we had no idea what it was for. So we foolishly attached the nozzle to the tire, the typical loud wheezing sound occurs but never subsides. As the gauge hand of the pump swung left at an ever accelerating rate, panic ensued. Luckily it was just a matter of pushing and proding the ring back into the pump nozzle. Anyways, I drained a large amount of what remained of my energy because of this pumping debacle and I was ready to call it quits.</p>

<p>We had no idea things were going to get much, much worse.</p>

<p>PS: I’m not sorry for the title pun ☺</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2016/03/13/the-great-free-speech-conundrum/">The Great Free Speech Conundrum</a></h1>
      <p>Freedom of speech is generally defined as “the right to communicate one’s opinions and ideas without fear of government retaliation or censorship”. Sounds perfectly reasonable and perfectly necessary for a modern society. A government that allows it’s citizens to voice their opinions is a government that welcomes innovation, improvement, and very importantly, protects itself from corruption.</p>

<p>However, reality is infinitely more complex. The modern information age allows people that are tens of thousands of miles away to communicate as if they were right next to each other. Opinions and ideas can be spread to millions of people halfway across the globe in an instant. This obviously comes with a myriad of advantages for civilization at large. The quick distribution of ideas enables collaboration and innovation at a scale never before seen. BUT, it also allows for malicious entities to manipulate millions of people quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>Before I continue, I would like to point out how powerful a unified, angry population is. Governments throughout the ages have been created and toppled by the will of the governed. Notable historical Western examples include the French and Russian revolutions where impoverished, passionate peasants tore down monarchies and executed the de facto rulers. More recent examples include the Arab Spring revolutions.</p>

<p>Now let’s shift perspectives. Humans are by nature competitive creatures and this trait is, if I dare say, amplified even further at the level of statehood. Most governments want the best for their population. A happy population makes for a successful government and one of the most direct ways to achieve this is through wealth. But wealth is not an infinite resource and when certain countries adopt foreign policies that directly affects another’s ability to grow in wealth, or stay wealthy, conflicts occur. In many cases, direct, open warfare follows. Fortunately, wars are risky, time consuming, and expensive.</p>

<p>A much more desirable option is to utilize the will of a government’s own people to change said government’s policies. The reasoning is crystal clear here. Why would you send your own citizens to fight wars when you could have the citizens of your enemies fight your wars for you?</p>

<p>But how does one government go about turning a significant group of a foreign country’s population against their own government? Ever heard of the term propaganda? Now let’s look at the internet and how incredibly easy it is to voice opinions and spread a message. Let’s be frank here, the internet is truly a perfect medium for propaganda dissemination. Foreign policy makers all over the world are not stupid; they understand the power of the internet and are actively using it to their advantage.</p>

<p>This is where the great free speech conundrum manifests itself. In an ideal world, a government would want its population to exercise free speech. What it does not want is to have foreign entities abuse local free speech policies to foster dissent and general social unrest. But how does one go about filtering out the “evil” speech from the “good” speech. When do you cross the line and start encroaching on the free speech rights of your own citizens? This is an incredibly hard problem that deserves more awareness and discussion than it receives today. I am of the opinion that people are quick to shun certain policies that have potential to violate free speech but is at the same time, necessary to protect the population from foreign, malevolent forces.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In any case, my main goal for this post is to hopefully get the reader thinking about this issue. As I’ve mentioned before, there is really no easy solution to the free speech conundrum (case in point, the NSA). However, I am hopeful that there is definitely a solution out there that correctly balances free speech and “internet protection” (sorry, I couldn’t think of a better term…) and the more dialogue there is on this issue, the faster we can reach a sensible compromise.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2016/03/12/on-growing-up-with-anxiety/">On growing up with anxiety&#8230;</a></h1>
      <p>To be honest I’m not completely comfortable with writing this post. I guess it’s probably because I’m sharing something about myself that I’m not entirely proud of… sort of like a secret, personal weakness that I’m exposing to the reader. I’ve long been able to cope and even overcome, if I daresay, most of these issues but there is this mysterious mental health stigma that pervades society and is definitely affecting me as I write this. However, I’m quite sure that many people can relate to at least some of my experiences and I hope that by sharing my anxiety story, I can somehow, in some way, help those that are still silently struggling against their inner beast.</p>

<p>My story begins in my adolescent years… sometime during middle school when I had a terrible bout of OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). Like most cases of OCD, it starts out with really minor things like having a tendency to set the audio volume to certain numbers and [ …some other trivial example. I added the “and” for sentence flow and I can’t think of any examples right now]. Most people are like this right? Perfectly normal unless you have a particular sensitivity towards OCD. Unfortunately I did and the symptoms became more and more severe. At the worst stages, I exhibited most of the textbook symptoms of OCD like having elaborate, stressful, and terribly time consuming rituals that involved things like obsessive handwashing and ordering objects in my room (ordering as in making sure everything is in the perfect place, any object that’s even a tad bit off angle MUST be corrected at all costs).</p>

<p>So why did I act out all these “rituals”? At the core of the problem was anxiety. Most of the time I acted because I was scared that if I didn’t, something bad would happen. Maybe this is why there’s this stigma around mental health. It’s just weird, silly, hard to explain, and incredibly embarrassing. In any case, it’s embarrassing at my expense so please keep reading ;)</p>

<p>Also, as a side note, this is why these OCD rituals are so time consuming. If I didn’t do one correctly, I had a primal desire to restart. And restart I did. Many, many times.</p>

<p>One of the ABSOLUTE WORST things about having OCD as a child, at least for me, was that I didn’t understand this and I was scared and embarrassed to talk about it to anyone around me. It wasn’t my OCD symptoms that made it hard for me to share though, it was all the fears, the worrying thoughts that were driving me to act out on them. These thoughts were horrible and often times weird and irrational. So irrational that I don’t even want to talk about them now. Fortunately, I was able to grow out of OCD but I couldn’t free myself of these thoughts.</p>

<p>It is my understanding today that all these negative thoughts were the manifestation of my anxiety. This struggle with OCD was just a small battle in my overarching war against it.</p>

<p>Come high school, I was rid of OCD but anxiety was a monster that clung to me and struck time and time again. I’ve always thought of myself as a little slower to mature emotionally compared to my peers and this, combined with all the negative emotions from anxiety, made a potent combination that, at times, overwhelmed me. Needless to say, high school wasn’t easy.</p>

<p>Again, I kept everything to myself. It was the same story, anxiety created worries and fears that were too weird and embarrassing to share. If I couldn’t share the root cause of my frustration and depression, how could anyone else help?</p>

<p>So I soldiered on and come university, things turned for the better as I became more emotionally mature and as they say, “grew into myself”. But I still had anxiety and I still had these thoughts. They were not necessarily the same as the thoughts a year ago or even a couple months ago but they were just as embarrasing, just as irrational. Anxiety “attacks” were less frequent but not any bit less potent. At the height of any one attack, rational thought is completely and utterly overwhelmed by negative emotions. It sucks.</p>

<p>In any case, this is a HAPPY story and I did eventually overcome anxiety in a spectacular fashion. Word choice is important here, because I never really got rid of anxiety. It’s still a beast that continues today to affect me, albeit in a much more limited and tolerable fashion. I realised sometime around the start of my last school term that I’ve always tackled anxiety the wrong way. I alienated it, fought it, rejected it as a part of who I am. In other words, I couldn’t accept anxiety as being a part of me. But anxiety really is a part of me, and it is one of the many things that define who I am. This one thought, this one realization that I will never get rid of anxiety because it is a part of me made a profound change. Whenever I started obsessing over some stupid anxiety-driven thought, instead of fighting it, I accepted it. I embraced anxiety and stopped trying to control it. In return, my anxiety stopped controlling me. Magically, through acceptance, I stopped worrying.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="a-final-note">A final note…</h2>

<p>I didn’t mention this before but a lot of my anxiety-driven fears have another common theme besides being weird and embarrassing, they were always about LOSS. Somehow, deep within me, there is a strong, primal fear for loss. And this is how acceptance really helped. Instead of fearing loss, I mentally accepted loss. This is really hard to put into words but basically, if I was going to lose something and was powerless to stop it, I will lose it and then this loss becomes a part of who I am. This whole time the one thing that is constant, the one solid thing that I can rely on, is that I am me and that will never change :)</p>
